# SQL Business Insights Project

In this project, I have used SQL to perform an extensive analysis on business data. The goal was to generate business insights that can help in decision-making processes.

## About the Queries

1. **Market Analysis:** The query provides a list of markets where the customer "Atliq Exclusive" operates its business in the APAC region. This is crucial to understand the geographic distribution of the business.

2. **Product Increase Analysis:** This query calculates the percentage of unique product increase in 2021 vs. 2020. The understanding of product growth year over year can help to plan for inventory and supply chain management.

3. **Segment Analysis:** The query generates a report with all the unique product counts for each segment, sorted in descending order. This helps understand which segments are more product-diverse.

4. **Segment Growth Analysis:** This query determines the segment with the most increase in unique products in 2021 vs 2020. This provides insights into the fastest-growing product segments.

5. **Manufacturing Cost Analysis:** The query returns the products with the highest and lowest manufacturing costs. This aids in understanding the cost structure of the products.

6. **Discount Analysis:** The query generates a report of the top 5 customers who received an average high pre_invoice_discount_pct for the fiscal year 2021 in the Indian market. This can be used to understand the discount structure provided to the customers.
